## Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
 
### Conceptual Understanding
 
- **Onion Architecture:** No
- **MVC Pattern:** Yes
- **Web API:** No
### Application & Bottlenecks
### Onion Architecture
 
- **Benefits:** Improved Developer Experience, Scalability, and Testability
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** Yes, because there is a learning curve for those who are not familiar with the Onion Architecture pattern. Proper implementation of the architecture requires a thorough understanding of software design concepts and extra effort. Architectural boundaries that must be respected might make things more complicated.
 
### MVC
- **Components**
- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. It manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain.
- **View:** Represents the presentation layer, responsible for rendering the user interface based on the data from the model. It presents information to the user and captures user interactions.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It handles user input, updates the model based on that input, and selects the appropriate view to present the updated data to the user.
 
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** yes, but i will continue to study MVC components.
 
### Web API
 
- **Differences from MVC:** Traditional MVC applications are primarily designed for rendering HTML views in a web browser. They consist of Models, Views, and Controllers, where the controller handles user input, interacts with the model, and determines the view to be displayed. On the other hand, Web APIs are designed for exchanging data between clients and servers, typically in JSON or XML format. They provide endpoints that allow clients to request and manipulate data, making them ideal for building backend services, mobile applications, or single-page applications.
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** yes, but i will continue to study MVC components.
